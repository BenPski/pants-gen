        with possibly a length adjustment with -l N. If the default symbols cause problems try: -s 0 -c '$_-+|1+' or something similar to substitute in a restricted set of symbols.\
        To fully alter the spec use something like --spec '20//1+|charset1//2|charset2 and customize fairly freely.",
    after_help = "General formatting follows the style of INTERVAL|CHARSET \
        and the overall spec is a combination of these and a length as length//INTERVAL|CHARSET//. \
        A CHARSET is any character and there are special charset patterns\
        (:upper:, :lower:, :number:, :symbol:). An interval follows the form N for\
        exactly N characters, N+ for at least N characters, N- for at most N characters,\
        and A-B for the range of A to B characters. The interface works by having\
        a default password specification and then allowing for modifications as needed."
